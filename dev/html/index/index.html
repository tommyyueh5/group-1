                                in Madrid, hailing the 6,000 staff who work there as heroes.
                                Spain has seen more than 20,000 deaths and the Madrid region is at the heart of it:
                                a
                                capital city blighted by this virus.

                                This city has seen 7,000 deaths, more than other European capitals.

                                The contagion spread at a remarkable rate through the densely populated city and its
                                cluster
                                of suburbs.

                                The real death toll could be considerably higher as Madrid's regional government has
                                revealed only 800 of 4,260 care home residents suspected of dying from Covid-19 were
                                tested.
